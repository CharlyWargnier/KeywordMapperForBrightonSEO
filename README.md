As part of my Brightonseo talk, I created a mighty Streamlit app which auto-maps your keywords to your crawled URLs! 

+ Uses fuzzy matching techniques to map keywords to URLs
+ I made it simple for you to understand whatâ€™s under the hood!
+ Free to use it and tweak in your own projects!

You can try the app here:
